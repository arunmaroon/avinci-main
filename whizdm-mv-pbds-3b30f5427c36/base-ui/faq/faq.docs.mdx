        A. You can get an instant loan on Money View without any paperwork by following these steps: Complete and submit your loan
        application on the app. Once you've submitted your loan application, we'll go throught your documents and assess your
        creditworthiness along with the other important details on your application. Post the verification process, we’ll send you a NACH
        form, which you're required to print, sing on, scan, and send back to us. This NACH form is to enable the auto debit facility for
        your bank account so you can pay your EMIs on time automatically. On recieving your NACH form, we’ll send you a loan agreement on
        the app. You'll need to review and submit the agreement. Post this, your loan amount will be credited into your bank account in a
        few hours.
