All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-10-07

### üéâ Major Release: UI Feedback Layer

**New Features:**

#### UI Feedback Capabilities
- **Image Upload for Critique**: Users can now share UI designs (wireframes, mockups, screenshots) in chat
- **GPT-4 Vision Integration**: Agents use GPT-4o to view and analyze designs
- **Persona-Aware Feedback**: Critiques tied directly to transcript experiences and pain points
- **Human-Like Responses**: Feedback feels authentic, empathetic, no AI jargon

Example:
```
Agent: "This form asks company details‚Äîbig problem for self-employed like me, 
I'd quit the app! Reminds me of Money View's issues..."
```

#### Enhanced Persona Extraction
- Added `ui_preferences` field (e.g., "short processes", "transparency")
- Added `ui_pain_points` field (e.g., "lagging apps", "unnecessary questions")
- Added `extrapolation_hint` to guide UI feedback behavior
- Improved JSON structure for better agent context

#### Scaling & Storage
- **SQLite Database**: Store 100s of agents persistently
- `ui_agents` table: Agent metadata and personas
- `feedback_history` table: Complete interaction logs
- Load existing agents across sessions
- Track feedback counts and last responses

#### Analytics & Insights
- **Feedback Analysis Dashboard**: View all interactions in table format
- **Theme Clustering**: Automatically group feedback by common patterns
- **Trait Linking**: Identify which persona attribute triggered each response
- **Session Export**: Download complete chat history as JSON
- **CSV Export**: Ready for external analysis tools

#### UI/UX Improvements
- üé® Emoji-based section headers for better navigation
- Expander components for persona previews
- Two-column layout (chat + agent info)
- Progress bars for batch processing
- Image previews for shared designs
- Streamlined sidebar organization

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Multi-File Upload**: Process multiple transcripts simultaneously
- **Batch Agent Generation**: Create agents from 10+ transcripts at once
- **ImageFeedbackTool Class**: Modular vision-based critique system
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Text-based critique if vision API unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Robust parsing and recovery mechanisms

### üìö Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive project overview
- **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step instructions with examples
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Technical architecture and implementation details
- **Sample Transcript**: Real-world example (Abdul's loan app experience)
- **Mock UI Image**: Pre-generated loan form for testing
- **Test Suite**: Automated functionality validation

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed PDF extraction for encrypted files (graceful error handling)
- Resolved session state persistence across reruns
- Improved chat history display formatting
- Fixed image path handling for Windows/Linux compatibility

## Upgrade Path: v1 ‚Üí v2

### Breaking Changes
None - v2 is fully backward compatible with v1 transcripts

### Migration Steps
1. Pull latest code
2. Install new dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Update `OPENAI_API_KEY` to support GPT-4o (for vision)
4. Run app: `streamlit run app.py`
5. Existing transcripts work as-is
6. New UI feedback features available immediately

### What's Preserved
- Existing transcript format
- Persona extraction structure (extended, not replaced)
- Chat interface behavior
- API key configuration

### What's New
- Image upload capability
- Database storage (agents.db created automatically)
- Analytics dashboard
- Enhanced persona fields
